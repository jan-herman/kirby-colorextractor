# Kirby Color Extractor

> Quick and dirty fork of Sylvain Julé's [Kirby 3 – Color extractor](https://github.com/sylvainjule/kirby-colorextractor) that uses [Color Thief](https://github.com/ksubileau/color-thief-php/) instead of [League\ColorExtractor](https://github.com/thephpleague/color-extractor).
